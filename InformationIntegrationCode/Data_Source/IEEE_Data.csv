"Design of Practical Information Multidimensional Integration System for Higher Vocational Ideological and Political Courses Facing Big Data","X. Ding","Suzhou Polytechnic Institute of Agriculture","2019 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Intelligent Systems (ICVRIS)","","2019","","","386","390","In view of the fact that the current information integration system can not quickly integrate a large number of chaotic practical information, this paper designs a multi-dimensional integration system of practical information for ideological and political courses in higher vocational colleges. The main control chip, TMS320C6748, is used to control the whole operation of the system. The physical server stores the information data and communicates with the serial port to transfer the data. Through the method of FPGA, the cluttered practical information data is filtered. According to the principle of Bayesian algorithm, the filtered information data is classified and the information data is preprocessed. In the SQL database, XML technology is used to parse and transform the pre-processed information and data. The data transformed into XML format is unified. According to the set multi-dimensional integration rules, data streams are split in the middle layer of the database and then merged is omorphically and heterogeneously. The data is loaded and stored in the integrated database, and finally the integration of information and data is completed. The design of multi-dimensional integration system is completed through hardware and software design. Comparing with the current information integration system, the experiment verifies the speed of information integration time of the designed multi-dimensional integration system. When integrating different amounts of practical information, the integration time of the designed multi-dimensional integration system is about one third of that of the current information integration system.","","978-1-7281-5050-5","10.1109/ICVRIS.2019.00100","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920804","big data;higher vocational ideological and political course;multidimensional integration;system design","Databases;XML;Servers;Information filters;Big Data;Education","Big Data;computer aided instruction;data analysis;data mining;digital signal processing chips;educational courses;educational institutions;field programmable gate arrays;SQL;vocational training;XML","cluttered practical information data;filtered information data;pre-processed information;set multidimensional integration rules;data streams;integrated database;current information integration system;information integration time;designed multidimensional integration system;practical information multidimensional integration system;political courses facing big data;chaotic practical information","","","10","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In nutrition science, a graph database enables the creation of multilateral logic relationships throughout the database, which can be used to electronically store, visualize, and scale the outputs of nutritional research. It provides a knowledge structure to standardize nutritional research outputs, which is both human- and machine-readable in a Resource Description Framework format. However, the development of various specific graph databases may cause difficulties for data integration and decrease human-readability. In this article, we propose an approach to develop a graph database according to the Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom or “DIKW” pyramid for nutritional epidemiologic data. Then, authoritative ontologies are suggested to construct the nodes and edges of the graph database to facilitate data integration. Finally, the findability and re-usability of the knowledge in the graph database are showcased using the SPARQL and SQWRL query languages.","","978-1-7281-0858-2","10.1109/BigData47090.2019.9006469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006469","nutritional epidemiology;graph database;reporting guidelines;data integration;information query","Databases;Ontologies;Semantics;Diseases;Data integration;Guidelines;Standards","data integration;database management systems;graph theory;medical information systems;ontologies (artificial intelligence);query languages;query processing","graph database;nutrition science;nutritional research outputs;data integration;nutritional epidemiologic data;SQWRL query languages;SPARQL;ontologies;resource description framework","","","14","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Part of the data preparation, standardization, and cleaning processes, such as data matching and deduplication for instance, could be automated by making a ML model ""learn"" and predict the matches routinely. Data integration can also benefit from ML as the data to be integrated can be sampled and used to design the data integration algorithms. After the initial manual work to setup the labels, ML models can start learning from the new incoming data that are being submitted for standardization, integration, and cleaning. The more data supplied to the model, the better the ML algorithm can perform and deliver accurate results. Therefore, ML is more scalable compared to traditional and time-consuming approaches. Nevertheless, many ML algorithms require an out-of-the-box tuning and their parameters and scope are often not adapted to the problem at hand. To make an example, in cleaning and integration processes, the window sizes of values used for the ML models cannot be arbitrarily chosen and require an adaptation of the learning parameters. This tutorial will survey the recent trend of applying machine learning solutions to improve data management tasks and establish new paradigms to sharpen data error detection, cleaning, and integration at the data instance level, as well as at schema, system, and user levels.","2375-026X","978-1-5386-5520-7","10.1109/ICDE.2018.00226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8509447","machine learning;data cleaning;error detection;data repairing;query inference;data management;clustering;classification","Databases;Task analysis;Cleaning;Data integration;Data models;Machine learning;Tutorials","data integration;data integrity;database management systems;inference mechanisms;learning (artificial intelligence);query processing","machine learning techniques;data management tasks;data cleaning;data preparation;data matching;deduplication;data integration algorithms;learning parameters;data error detection;data instance level;query inference","","","50","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The integration of HTML table consists of three phases: (1) extraction of the structure of the tables; (2) integration of the tables' schema; (3) integration of the data values. To solve the conflicts in semantics and naming in the tables schema, domain-ontology is used. To improve quality of integration of data values in the tables, the vector space model is used to check the duplications of data values. As the integration result, a single HTML table is obtained. The approach is implemented on an engine built using Phyton. Results of the experiment shows that the engine can successfully integrate two HTML tables into single table.","","978-1-4673-8430-8","10.1109/ICODSE.2015.7436985","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7436985","data integration;HTML table;ontology;table integration;web page","HTML;Layout;Web pages;Semantics;Ontologies;Particle separators;Standards","data integration;hypermedia markup languages;ontologies (artificial intelligence);Web sites","Web pages;HTML table integration;data value integration;table schema integration;tables schema, naming;tables schema semantics;domain-ontology;vector space model;data value duplication checking;Phyton","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results of the study show that to apply SoBI, dashboard application must be made that serves to manage data integration process. Data integration on SoBi is done with the help of Web Service by building Service Provider at location of data source and Service Requestor on dashboard application. The Service Provider can be called by the dashboard application to perform the data retrieval process from the data source and transfer data into the Data Warehouse, so that the ETL process is done entirely by the Web Service.

Data integration is needed because we just re-hosted some of our data on a remote cloud service. Thus, the inventory system that's still running on a mainframe in the data center needs to share data with the sales order system that's now on AWS.

In a data integration system, a mediator is defined as unique entry point providing transparent access to distributed, autonomous and heterogeneous data sources. In such an architecture, security issue and access control in particular is considered as challenging tasks. Indeed, every source, designed independently from the others, uses its own access control policy to protect their data. The central challenge identified in this context is: How to synthesize a global policy at the mediator level that complies with the policies of the sources? Complying with the sources' policies means that an unauthorized access at the source level should also be unauthorized at the mediator level. Also, the policy of the mediator should ensure data protection against indirect accesses. An indirect access may take place when one could infer sensitive information from non-sensitive one by using semantic constraints. We propose a methodology that can help to synthesize a global policy with a global schema and to detect security breaches by reasoning about semantic constraints.","","978-1-5090-6558-5","10.1109/FAS-W.2017.146","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8064122","Data integration;access control policies;formal concept analysis","Data integration;Authorization;Semantics;Algorithm design and analysis;Databases","authorisation;data integration","access control policy;data integration system;transparent access;distributed data sources;autonomous data sources;heterogeneous data sources;global policy;mediator level;source level;security issue;security breaches;reasoning;semantic constraints","","","12","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Record linkage plays an important component during data integration to detect and link similar data instances. However, personal and sensitive data need to be protected in a manner so that there is no re-identification of original attribute values by the party performing record linkage. Now-a-days, the Bloom filter encoding has utilized across many countries for privacy preserving record linkage. Moreover, the hardened approaches of Bloom filter encoding enhance privacy at the cost of reduced linkage accuracy. Still the security concerns remain with the Bloom filter encoding techniques because attackers can re-identify the obfuscated data with the use of available public resources. We propose an enhanced approach for privacy preserving record linkage (EPPRL) during data integration to achieve better privacy with acceptable linkage accuracy.

Data, service and user interfaces are implemented as a toolset stack, for developing applications with functionalities of information retrieval, data processing, analysing and visualizing. We discuss a use case of healthcare data integration as an example, where information is collected and aggregated from diverse sources such as electronic health records (EHRs), personal health records (PHRs) and wearable devices.

In this paper, we develop a most-benefit approach (MBA) for ordering candidate data sources for user integration. At the core of this approach is a utility function that quantifies the utility of a given the state of integration system; thus, we devise a utility function for integration system based on query result number. We show in practice how to efficiently apply MBA in concert with this utility function to order data sources. A detailed experimental evaluation on real datasets shows that the ordering of data sources produced by this MBA-based yields a integration system with a significantly higher utility than a wide range of other ordering strategies.","","978-0-7695-3646-0","10.1109/WMWA.2009.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5232496","deep web;data integration;most-benefit;order data source;data source selection","Large scale integration;Application software;Data mining;Crawlers;Costs;HTML;Information processing;Software engineering;Information technology;Rendering (computer graphics)","data mining;Internet;query processing","data source selection;large-scale deep Web data integration system;data mining;MBA;most-benefit approach;ordering candidate data source;utility function;query result number","","4","9","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In big data, handling a variety of data is significantly similar to dealing with the volume and velocity-rich information. Big data often deals with the storage of redundant information in heterogeneous formats from multiple data sources. To effectively manipulate the information of big data, the organizations necessitate data integration among the variety of data sources. Most of the real-time applications heavily rely on the evolution of available heterogeneous information sources. Consequently, data integration deals with the heterogeneity in the syntactic, schematic, or semantic structure of big data sources. In essence, data integration meets the interoperability problems in the big data environment while mapping the data or schema. Ontology-based data integration has been emerged as an active research area to overcome these constraints. Semantic web technology plays a crucial role in managing the disparate big data sources. With the assistance of semantic knowledge, the previous research works integrate the disparate data sources. Thus, this work provides a brief survey of semantic data integration in a big data environment. Semantic data integration is the process of inter-linking the data based on the conceptual representation and the relationships of the data. This work describes the significance of ontology in heterogeneous data sources integration with the advantages of big data. Furthermore, it presents the use-case of the 360-degree view of the customer for semantic integration in a real-world scenario. Finally, it concludes that the ontology-based integration models offer potential benefits for big data manipulation in different application fields.","","978-1-7281-2746-0","10.1109/CDMA47397.2020.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9044279","Semantic integration;ontologies;integration;database;big data;heterogeneous information.","","Big Data;data integration;ontologies (artificial intelligence);open systems;semantic Web","semantic data integration perspectives;Big Data management;ontology-based data integration;heterogeneous data source integration;interoperability problems;semantic Web technology;Big Data sources","","","45","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, extracting maximal value from this data can be challenging for many reasons. For example, datasets are often not stored using human-understandable terms, making it difficult for a large set of users to benefit from them. Further, given that different types of data may be best stored using different technologies, datasets that are closely related may be stored separately with no explicit linkage. Finally, even within individual data stores, there are often inconsistencies in data representations, whether introduced over time or due to different data producers. These challenges are further compounded by frequent additions to the data, including new raw data as well as results produced by large-scale analytics. Thus, even within a single Big Data environment, it is often the case that multiple rich datasets exist without the means to access them in a unified and cohesive way, often leading to lost value. This paper describes the development of a Big Data management infrastructure with semantic technologies at its core to provide a unified data access layer and a consistent approach to analytic execution. Semantic technologies were used to create domain models describing mutually relevant datasets and the relationships between them, with a graphical user interface to transparently query across datasets using domain-model terms. This prototype system was built for GE Power & Water's Power Generation Products Engineering Division, which has produced over 50TB of gas turbine and component prototype test data to date.

It extends data aggregation techniques by navigating paths where a single table is traversed multiple times. Such paths are not considered by existing techniques, which results in the loss of several attributes. Our framework also prevents leakage of the class information by avoiding features built after the knowledge of the class label. Experiments are performed on transactional data of a U.S. consumer electronics retailer to predict causes of product returns.

DBMS vendors are providing gateways into their products, and SQL is being retrofitted on many older DBMSs to make it easier to access data from standard 4GL products and application development systems. The next step needed for integration of data is to provide a common data dictionary with a conceptual schema across the data to mask the many differences that occur when databases are developed independently. Data Integration Inc. has two products for addressing the problem: the InterViso IVBuild for developing the common data dictionary, and InterViso IVQuery for access to diverse databases. IVQuery is a DBMS front-end that allows a user to access data that is managed by existing DBMSs. IVQuery needs the definition of the existing databases, ""local schemas"" and a view across the databases, the ""federated schema"", which are stored in a DD/D (data dictionary /directory). The DD/D Builder program, called IVBuild, is used to develop and maintain the DD/D. IVBuild differs from other data modeling tools in that the description of the individual databases is input rather than output.<>","","0-8186-6400-2","10.1109/PDIS.1994.331705","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=331705","","Dictionaries;Application software;Standards development;Encoding;Programming profession;Workstations;Database languages;Data warehouses;Relational databases","data structures;database management systems;distributed databases;user interfaces;file servers;computer communications software","data integration server;connectivity products;DBMS vendors;SQL;common data dictionary;conceptual schema;Data Integration;InterViso IVBuild;InterViso IVQuery;diverse databases;DBMS front-end;local schemas;federated schema;DD/D;data dictionary /directory;data modeling tools","","","","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides, unstructured content, e.g., emails and documents, constitutes more than half of the entire enterprise data and contains a lot of implicit knowledge about warehouse entities. Thus, holistic ana-lytics require the integration of structured warehouse data and unstructured content to generate novel insights. These insights can also be used to enrich the integrated data and to create a new basis for further analytics. Existing integration approaches only support a limited range of analytical applications and require the costly adaptation of the warehouse schema. In this paper, we present the Deep Data Warehouse (DeepDWH), a novel type of data warehouse based on the flexible integration and enrichment of warehouse data and unstructured content, addressing the variety challenge of Big Data. It relies on information-rich in-stance-level links between warehouse elements and content items, which are represented in a graph-oriented structure. Neither adaptations of the existing warehouse nor the design of an overall federated schema are required.

Specifically, in the biomedical domain, the size of the data has increased exponentially in the last decade, and with the advances in the technologies to collect and generate data, a faster growth rate is expected for the next years. The available collections of data are characterized by the dominant dimensions of big data, i.e., they are not only large in volume, but they can be also heterogeneous and present quality issues. These data complexity problems impact on the typical tasks of data management, and particularly, in the task of integrating big biomedical data sources. We tackle the problem of big data integration and present a knowledge-driven framework able to extract and integrate data collected from structured and unstructured data sources. The proposed framework resorts to Natural Language Processing techniques to extract knowledge from unstructured data and short text. Furthermore, ontologies and controlled vocabularies, e.g., UMLS, are utilized to annotate the extracted entities and relations with terms from the ontology or controlled vocabulary. The annotated data is integrated into a knowledge graph. A unified schema is used to describe the meaning of the integrated data as well as the main properties and relations. As proof of concept, we show the results of applying the proposed framework to integrate clinical records from lung cancer patients with data extracted from open data sources like Drugbank and PubMed.

This work focuses on the integration of tree-like hierarchical data or information that when modeled as a relational schema can take the shape of a flat schema, a self-referential schema or a hybrid schema. Examples include evolutionary taxonomies, geological time scales, and organizational charts. Given the observed complexity in developing ETL processes for this particular but common type of data, our work focuses on reducing the time and effort required to map and transform this data. Our research automates and simplifies the transformation from ranked self-referential to flat representations (and vice-versa), by: (a) proposing MSL+, an extension to IBM's Mapping Specification Language (MSL), to succinctly express the mapping between schemas while hiding the actual transformation implementation complexity from the user, and (b) implementing a transformation component for the Talend open-source ETL platform, called Tree Transformer (TT). We evaluated MSL+ and TT, in the context of biodiversity data integration, where this class of transformations is a recurring pattern. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MSL+ with respect to development time savings as well as a 2 to 25-fold performance improvement in transformation time achieved by TT when compared to existing implementations and to Talend built-in components.","","978-1-4799-5880-1","10.1109/IRI.2014.7051899","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7051899","data integration;self-referential schema;mapping language;data transformation;ETL","Data integration;Cities and towns;Data models;Complexity theory;XML;Continents;Transforms","data integration;formal specification","ranked hierarchical trees;data integration systems;mapping specifications;heterogeneous data sources;extract transform and load;ETL data;structural differences;tree like hierarchical data;relational schema;flat schema;evolutionary taxonomies;geological time scales;organizational charts;observed complexity;IBM mapping specification language;MSL;transformation implementation complexity;transformation component;tree transformer;biodiversity data integration","","","21","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, a novel data conflict resolution approach based on Markov Logic Networks (MLNs) for Ontology based data integration is devised. Ontology is used to handle semantic heterogeneity that would result in increase in the recall rate and precision of the result is increased by resolving data conflicts and thus the system ensures that the user always receives high-quality data for the user query.

Recently, education data has drawback of being able to be reused by other software, which results in data have to be migrated manually every time there is a change in other databases that also use education data. To enable data to be synchronized without having to migrate data manually, it is necessary to integrate and convert data into data that can be connected with other data in other software. Data structure that can be used by other software and enable data to be integrated is Linked Data. From this problem, this paper aims to build a tool to make data integrated and linked with other data in other software to automate migration. The tool will receive data input that will be converted into Linked Data. The resulted Linked Data then will be stored in RDF Store and can be fetched by other software through Web API or SPARQL Query Endpoint. In addition, users can explore the resulted Linked Data through RDF Subject Page. Based on the results of evaluations carried out using basic education data and PPDB 2018 data from Bandung State Junior High School 45, the built tool can produce integrated data that also can be used by other software.

The global semantic data model applied to various oil fields is set up by ontology extraction, ontology evolution, ontology combination and semantic constraints. The domain-oriented data integration to provide the data access and shared service is realized by ontology mapping, query transformation, and data cleaning. Users and upper applications can have a direct access to underlying complex data sources in times of need through the global semantic data model, and the cleaned data can be returned in a unified format.

BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations such as reporting, online analytical processing, business performance management, competitive intelligence, benchmarking, and predictive analytics. Web Services technologies responded quickly to help such evolution and in many situations the Web Services application is driving businesses and dictating a new way of doing business. Web information usually contains multimedia data with unstructured fashions. Through the effective analysis of company's Web information, we could make effective market analysis, compare customer feedback on similar products, discover the strengths and weaknesses of their competitors, retain highly valuable customers, and make smart business decisions. In this paper, we discuss two case studies on data integration and data mining. The first case is for the traditional data analytics using relational database techniques such as Oracle database and Cognos BI tool for integrating and mining a company's web site. The second case is for multimedia data analytics using Monago database and Pentaho BI tool for integrating and mining multimedia data presented in a company's web site.

Prior research has suggested that cancer survival is influenced by multiple factors from multiple levels. Most of existing analyses of cancer survival used data from a single source. Nevertheless, there are key challenges in integrating variables from different sources. Data integration is a daunting task because data from different sources can be heterogeneous in syntax, schema, and particularly semantics. Thus, we propose to adopt a semantic data integration approach that generates a universal conceptual representation of “information” including data and their relationships. This paper describes a case study of semantic data integration linking three data sets that cover both individual and contextual level factors for the purpose of assessing the association of the predictors of interest with cancer survival using cox proportional hazard models.","","978-1-5090-3050-7","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217849","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217849","semantic data integration;ontology-based data access;cancer survival;integrative data analysis","Semantics;Cancer;Data integration;Ontologies;Data models;Data analysis","cancer;data analysis;data integration;medical computing;ontologies (artificial intelligence)","integrative data analysis;cancer survival rates;semantic data integration approach;cancer prognosis;ontology-based data access;universal conceptual representation","","","6","","","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is not only the volume of the data but also the speed, variety, and uncertainty, which are promoting a massive challenge for traditional technologies such as data warehouse. These diverse and unprecedented characteristics have engendered the notion of “Big Data.” The data-intensive industries have been experiencing a wide variety of challenges in terms of processing, managing, and analysis of data. For instance, the healthcare sector is confronting difficulties in respect of integration or fusion of diverse medical data stemming from multiple heterogeneous sources. Data integration is critically important within the healthcare sector because it enriches data, enhances its value, and more importantly paves a solid foundation for highly efficient and effective healthcare analytics such as predicting diseases or an outbreak.
